This is the full Hangman game! Note how there are also stories for the individual UI components,
developed one at at time before being put together in this main <code>Hangman</code> app component.

Also note how none of almost none of the game logic resides in the components; they are instead
found in separate functions (a "logic layer") for portability and testability.
